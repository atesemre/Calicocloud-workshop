# Module 3: Joining EKS cluster to Calico Cloud

**Goal:** Join EKS cluster to Calico Cloud management plane.

>In order to complete this module, you must have [Calico Cloud trial account](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico-cloud/).

## Steps

1. Join EKS cluster to Calico Cloud management plane.

    Use Calico Cloud install script provided in the welcome email for Calico Cloud trial account.

    ```bash
    # script should look similar to this
    curl https://installer.calicocloud.io/xxxxxx_yyyyyyy-saay-management_install.sh | bash
    ```

    Joining the cluster to Calico Cloud can take a few minutes. Wait for the installation script to finish before you proceed to the next step.

    You should see the output similar to this:

    ```text

    [INFO] Creating Tigera Pull Secret

    .....
    ```

2. Configure log aggregation and flush intervals.

    ```bash
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsFlushInterval":"10s"}}'
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"dnsLogsFlushInterval":"10s"}}'
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsFileAggregationKindForAllowed":1}}'
    ```

3. Configure Felix for log data collection.

    >[Felix](https://docs.tigera.io/reference/architecture/overview#felix) is one of Calico components that is responsible for configuring routes, ACLs, and anything else required on the host to provide desired connectivity for the endpoints on that host.

    ```bash
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"policySyncPathPrefix":"/var/run/nodeagent","l7LogsFileEnabled":true}}'
    ```
