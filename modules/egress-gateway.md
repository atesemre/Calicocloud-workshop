# Module 2-2: North-South Controls-Egress Gateway

Refer to the documentation to [enable and configure Egress Gateways (EG)](https://docs.tigera.io/networking/egress-gateway) capability.

**Goal:** Configure egress gateway for specific workloads so they are using a predefined ip pool instead of ephemeral IPs to reachout the external resource, for example firewalls.
