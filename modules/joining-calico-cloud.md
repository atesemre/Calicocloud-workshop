# Joining your cluster to Calico Cloud

**Goal:** Join cluster to Calico Cloud management plane.

IMPORTANT: In order to complete this module, you must have [Calico Cloud trial account](https://www.calicocloud.io/home). Issues with being unable to navigate menus in the UI are often due to browsers blocking scripts - please ensure you disable any script blockers.

## Steps

1. Navigate to [https://www.calicocloud.io/home](https://www.calicocloud.io/home) and sign up for a 14 day trial account - no credit cards required. Returning users can login.

2. Upon signing into the Calico Cloud UI the Welcome screen shows four use cases which will give a quick tour for learning more. This step can be skipped. Tip: the menu icons on the left can be expanded to display the worded menu as shown:

   ![expand-menu](../img/expand-menu.png)


3. Join your cluster to Calico Cloud management plane.
    
    Click the "Managed Cluster" in your left side of browser.
    ![managed-cluster](../img/managed-cluster.png)
    
    Click on "connect cluster"
     ![connect-cluster](../img/connect-cluster.png)

    choose your and click next, use aks as example
      ![choose-aks](../img/choose-aks.png)


    run installation script in your cluster. 
    ```bash
    # script should look similar to this
    curl https://installer.calicocloud.io/xxxxxx_yyyyyyy-saay-management_install.sh | bash
    ```

    Joining the cluster to Calico Cloud can take a few minutes. Wait for the installation script to finish before you proceed to the next step.

    You should see the output similar to this:

    ```text

    ```

    ```bash
    # output once your cluster join the calico cloud
    Install Successful

    Your Connected Cluster Name is ######-management-managed-34-75-84-30  
    ```
    Set the Calico Cluster Name as a variable to use later in this workshop. The Cluster Name can also be obtained from the Calico Cloud Web UI at a later date. For the example above `CALICOCLUSTERNAME` should be set to __######-management-managed-34-75-84-30__
    
    ```bash
    export CALICOCLUSTERNAME=<Cluster Name>

    #For Linux terminal
    echo export CALICOCLUSTERNAME=$CALICOCLUSTERNAME | tee -a ~/.bash_profile

    #For Mac terminal
    echo export CALICOCLUSTERNAME=$CALICOCLUSTERNAME | tee -a ~/.zshrc 
    ```
    
    In calico cloud management UI, you can see your own aks cluster added in "managed cluster", you can also confirm by
    ```bash
    kubectl get tigerastatus
    ```
    
    ```bash
    #make sure all customer resources are "AVAILABLE=True" 
    NAME                            AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
    apiserver                       True        False         False      5m38s
    calico                          True        False         False      4m44s
    compliance                      True        False         False      4m34s
    intrusion-detection             True        False         False      4m49s
    log-collector                   True        False         False      4m19s
    management-cluster-connection   True        False         False      4m54s
    ```
    
4. Navigating the Calico Cloud UI

    Once the cluster has successfully connected to Calico Cloud you can review the cluster status in the UI. Click on `Managed Clusters` from the left side menu and look for the `connected` status of your cluster. You will also see a `Tigera-labs` cluster for demo purposes. Ensure you are in the correct cluster context by clicking the `Cluster` dropdown in the top right corner. This will list the connected clusters. Click on your cluster to switch context otherwise the current cluster context is in *bold* font.

5. Configure log aggregation and flush intervals in aks cluster, we will use 60s instead of default value 300s for lab testing only.   

    ```bash
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsFlushInterval":"10s"}}'
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"dnsLogsFlushInterval":"10s"}}'
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsFileAggregationKindForAllowed":1}}'
    ```

6. Configure Felix for log data collection in aks cluster

    ```bash
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"policySyncPathPrefix":"/var/run/nodeagent","l7LogsFileEnabled":true}}'

    ```

7. Configure Felix to collect TCP stats - this uses eBPF TC program and requires miniumum Kernel version of v5.3.0. Further [documentation](https://docs.tigera.io/visibility/elastic/flow/tcpstats)

    ```bash
    kubectl patch felixconfiguration default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsCollectTcpStats":true}}'
    ```
