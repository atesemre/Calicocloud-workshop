# Deep packet inspection (only available for calicocloud 3.10 version)

**Goal:** Use DPI on select workloads to efficiently make use of cluster resources and minimize the impact of false positives. 

>For each deep packet inspection resource (DeepPacketInspection), CalicoCloud creates a live network monitor that inspects the header and payload information of packets that match the [Snort community rules](https://www.snort.org/downloads/#rule-downloads). Whenever malicious activities are suspected, an alert is automatically added to the Alerts page in the Calico Manager UI.


## Steps

1. Configure deep packet inspection in your target workload, we will use `hipstershop/frontend` as example.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f demo/dpi/sample-dpi-frontend.yaml
   ```  
   

2. Configure resource requirements in IntrusionDetection.

  > For a data transfer rate of 1GB/sec on workload endpoints being monitored, we recommend a minimum of 1 CPU and 1GB RAM.
   
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f demo/dpi/resource-dpi.yaml
   ```

3. Verify deep packet inspection is running and the daemonset of `tigera-dpi` is also running. 


   ```bash
   kubectl get deeppacketinspections.crd.projectcalico.org -n hipstershop
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n tigera-dpi
   NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   tigera-dpi-66858   1/1     Running   0          3h58m
   tigera-dpi-x67sj   1/1     Running   0          3h58m
   ```

4. Trigger a snort alert basing on existing alert rules, we will use rule [21562](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-21562)    

   ```bash
   SVC_IP=$(kubectl -n hipstershop get svc frontend-external -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')

   # use below command if you are using EKS cluster. 
   ```
   
   ```bash
   #curl your loadbalancer with head and smk data from outside of cluster
   curl http://$SVC_IP:80 -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0' -XPOST --data-raw 'smk=1234'
   ```

5. Confirm the `Signature Triggered Alert` in manager UI and also in Kibana `ee_event`
